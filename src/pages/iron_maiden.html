        <p>Known for such powerful hits as "Two Minutes to Midnight" and "The Trooper," Iron Maiden are one of heavy
            metal's most influential bands. They're also one of metal's most enduring and distinctive acts, thanks to
            their melodic guitars, ambitious songwriting, powerhouse vocalist Bruce Dickinson, and iconic mascot Eddie.
            One of the first groups to be classified as "British metal," Iron Maiden helped set the rock scene for the
            '80s and inspired generations of subsequent bands, including Metallica, Dream Theater, Slipknot, In Flames,
            and Avenged Sevenfold. Despite a lack of radio airplay or mainstream media support, early allegations of
            Satanism, and a revolving lineup, they have remained consistently popular throughout their career.

        <p>Iron Maiden were formed in 1975 in Leyton, East London by bassist Steve Harris, formerly of the band Smiler.
            The group's lineup was volatile during its early years, but eventually settled on drummer Doug Sampson,
            guitarist Dave Murray, and vocalist Paul Di'Anno in 1978. Late that year, this incarnation of the band
            recorded a four-song demo and circulated it to club owners and others involved in the London scene,
            including the group's soon-to-be manager Ron Smallwood. The demo's popularity led Iron Maiden to
            self-release it as 1979's The Soundhouse Tapes EP, which soon sold out its 5,000-copy run. After scoring a
            deal with EMI, the band enlisted a second guitarist, Dennis Stratton. Late in 1979, Sampson departed due to
            health issues and former Samson drummer Clive Burr took his place behind the kit. The band's self-titled
            debut arrived in 1980; though it was recorded in a hurry, it was nonetheless a U.K. hit due to the single
            "Running Free." Its 1981 follow-up, Killers, had a harder approach thanks in part to producer Martin Birch
            -- with whom the group worked until his 1992 retirement -- and also saw the replacement of Stratton with
            Murray's childhood friend Adrian Smith.</p>

            The Number of the Beast Due to substance abuse issues, Di'Anno was dismissed from Iron Maiden after the
            Killer World Tour in 1981. His replacement was Bruce Dickinson, another former Samson member who joined that
            September and made his recorded debut with the band on 1982's groundbreaking The Number of the Beast.
            Boasting songs such as the title track and "Hallowed Be Thy Name," it became known as one of the all-time
            great rock albums. Though it was the band's first chart-topping album in the U.K. and was a Top Ten seller
            in several other countries, Christian activists and conservative politicians in America claimed the band was
            Satanic (which Iron Maiden denied). Nevertheless, The Number of the Beast's success made Iron Maiden
            international superstars, and despite the replacement of Burr with former Trust drummer Nicko McBrain, they
            changed very little of their style on 1983's Piece of Mind. The band undertook two major tours before
            recording 1984's Powerslave, which would go on to be another cult hit and featured the 13-minute epic "The
            Rime of the Ancient Mariner," which was inspired by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem. The product of
            Powerslave's 11-month tour was 1985's Live After Death, a double-live album featuring their biggest hit
            singles.</p>

        <p>Somewhere in Time Now established as a powerful and unique metal band, Iron Maiden experimented on their
            long-awaited 1986 album, Somewhere in Time, incorporating synthesized bass and guitar and futuristic themes.
            They continued to expand their sound and subject matter with 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Another
            concept album featuring the singles "The Evil That Men Do" and "The Clairvoyant," as well as the band's
            first use of keyboards, it was Maiden's most critically acclaimed album since The Number of the Beast. After
            that album's release, Smith and Dickinson worked on their own projects: Smith's album with his band ASAP
            arrived in 1989, while Dickinson's solo album, Tattooed Millionaire, appeared the following year.</p>
        <p>
            No Prayer for the Dying When Iron Maiden reconvened to work on a new album, Smith left over creative
            differences; ex-Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, who played on Tattooed Millionaire, joined the fold for 1990's
            No Prayer for the Dying. A return to the band's stripped-down sound of the early '80s, it gave Iron Maiden
            their first number one U.K. single with "Bring Your Daughter...To the Slaughter." At the end of the band's
            1991 tour, Dickinson expressed his desire to leave and work on his own music. However, he recorded another
            album, 1992's Fear of the Dark, and toured with the band, ultimately leaving in 1993. That year, two live
            albums were released: A Real Live One, which focused on their contemporaneous hit singles, and A Real Dead
            One, which featured Maiden's classic songs.
            The X FactorIron Maiden took some time off after Dickinson's departure, returning with 1995's The X Factor,
            which featured new singer and ex-Wolfsbane member Blaze Bayley. While the record didn't perform as well
            commercially as some of its predecessors, it was still a success in England. Its follow-up, 1998's Virtual
            XI, was one of the band's lowest-selling albums; in addition, Bayley was having issues with his voice, and
            he left Iron Maiden early in 1999. Soon after, Dickinson and Smith returned to the group, who released the
            ambitious, Kevin Shirley-produced Brave New World the following year.
